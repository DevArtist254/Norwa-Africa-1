          water treatment and water pumping solutions in Africa. We endeavour to
          address the water scarcity, the challenging water quality as well as
          the growing demand for green energy through solar solutions and water
          treatment machines. Since its establishment, Norwa Africa has been on
          a journey, seeking solutions in water pumping, solar power, water
          treatment for African communities and governments. With the growing
          water scarcity, need for renewable energy, and the numerous water
          quality concerns in Africa, Norwa Africa dedicates itself to provide
          reliable water treatment solutions in the most professional approach,
          to uplift our communities. We are proud of its success and look to the
