                If the water you pour from the tap in your home looks rusty or
                has reddish-brown particles that settle to the bottom, you
                likely have high levels of iron in your water. The nuisance of
                high iron concentrate often goes beyond just leaving orange,
                black, or gray stains on your fixtures and clothing. It can
                often leave a metallic smell and taste in your water and
                promotes the growth of Iron Reducing Bacteria which is extremely
                troublesome.
                <br />
                Water that is high in iron often also has elevated levels of
                manganese, hydrogen sulfide (often known simply as sulfur), and
                arsenic. A good water filter can usually remove the iron and
                also remove or sharply reduce many other contaminants as well. A
                backwashing whole house iron water filter is one of the most
                common ways of treating water that’s high in this metal, and the
                right filter can be very effective.

                  <p class="text font-smaller">
                    Chlorine is a great disinfectant but is not a good oxidizer,
                    thus the contact time in the retention tank. Be prepared to
                    clean out the bottom of the retention tank periodically.
                    Additionally, with cold well water, chlorine frequently
                    crystallizes at the injection point, and it plugs shut. You
                    will need to become an expert at cleaning the injection
                    fitting. Overall, if your iron is not over 8 ppm, chlorine
                    injection can be an economical method of removing iron from
                    your well water. We recommend to pass it through birm or
                    greensand to remove the oxidized iron.

                  <p class="text font-smaller">
                    A bed of greensand is comprised of manganese oxide coated
                    resin pellets or beads which provides both an oxidizing
                    environment and filtering capacity. Oxygen is released from
                    the manganese oxide coating to oxidize the dissolved iron in
                    the raw water passing through the bed. The oxidized iron
                    particles are trapped in the resin bed until removed during
                    the backwash cycle when the manganese oxide coating is
                    regenerated with chlorine or potassium permanganate.
                    <br />
                    The iron particles must be flushed out during the backwash
                    cycle so that the resin bed does not become clogged.
                    Greensand systems do not require high dissolved oxygen
                    content but work best when the water pH is above 7.5. These
                    systems are popular when a large volume of water is needed
                    and the iron is not over ten to twelve ppm.
