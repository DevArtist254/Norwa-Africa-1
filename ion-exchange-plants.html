              Effectively removing contaminants from liquids, providing
              successful separation, and efficiently catalyzing reactions
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our ion exchange plants are used in water treatment, including
              water softening, industrial demineralization, condensate
              polishing, ultrapure water production, and wastewater treatment.
              It can also provide a method of separation in many nonwater
              processes, such as desiccation and chromatographic separation. It
              has special utility in chemical synthesis, manufacturing, food
              processing, mining, power generation, agriculture, and a variety
              of applications and other industries.
