              <h2>Water Softeners Plants Designed For Superior Filtration</h2>
              <p>
                Norwa Africa can help you achieve superior filtration no matter
                your location! Water is classified as “hard water” when high
                amounts of calcium and magnesium are present. This causes
                minerals and other particles to buildup and form clogs in your
                pipes. To create soft water, a water softening system with
                sodium regeneration is installed. Complete Water Solutions
                offers a variety of water softening options, creating the
                perfect water service to meet your needs. Learn when you should
                have your water softener serviced here. Soft water is not only
                better for your pipes, but it also helps reduce scale on
                boilers, cooling towers, and other processes.

              <h2>Commercial and industrial water softeners plants</h2>
              <p>
                Norwa Africa water softeners are designed for industrial
                applications and commercial businesses. Softeners are used in
                many applications, including boiler makeup water and process
                water. The buildup caused by water hardness is capable of
                clogging, damaging pipes, and ruining equipment. Pipes and
                equipment last longer when used with soft water and keep
                maintenance costs down. Any facility dependent on boiler
                performance should use a water softener system to reduce the
                amount of scale forming minerals in the water. These minerals
                leave deposits in the boiler, which makes it harder to achieve
                the necessary temperatures for operation, making the process
                inefficient. Cooling towers also perform better with soft water.
